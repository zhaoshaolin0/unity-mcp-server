## Architecture

```
Claude / AI Assistant ←→ MCP Server (this repo) ←→ Unity Editor Plugin (HTTP bridge)
                                ↕
                          Unity Hub CLI
```

This server communicates with:
- **Unity Hub** via its CLI (supports both modern `--headless` and legacy `-- --headless` syntax)
- **Unity Editor** via the companion [unity-mcp-plugin](https://github.com/AnkleBreaker-Studio/unity-mcp-plugin) which runs an HTTP API inside the editor

### 330+ Tools Across 30+ Categories
> Scene management, GameObjects, components, physics, terrain, Shader Graph, Amplify Shader Editor, profiling, animation, NavMesh, builds, multiplayer, and more.

<p align="center">
  <img src="docs/unity-mcp-features.gif" alt="Unity MCP Features — 268 tools across 30+ categories for AI-powered game development" width="800" />
</p>

### Two-Tier Tool System

To avoid overwhelming MCP clients with 330+ tools, the server uses a two-tier architecture:
- **Core tools** (~70) are always exposed directly
- **Advanced tools** (254) are accessed via a single `unity_advanced_tool` proxy with lazy loading

This keeps the tool count manageable for clients like Claude Desktop and Cowork while still providing access to every Unity feature. Use `unity_list_advanced_tools` to discover all advanced tools by category.

### Multi-Instance Support

The server automatically discovers all running Unity Editor instances on startup. If only one instance is found, it auto-connects. If multiple instances are running (e.g., main editor + ParrelSync clones), it prompts you to select which one to work with.

**Port Resilience** — The server includes a multi-layer protection system for reliable multi-project workflows:

- **Port Identity Validation** — When restoring a saved connection, the server verifies the instance identity (project name + path) matches the expected target. If Unity restarts and a different project grabs the port, the server detects this and re-discovers the correct instance.
- **Compile-Time Resilience** — During long Unity compiles (when the editor is unresponsive), the server checks the shared instance registry. If the registry entry is fresh (updated within the last 5 minutes via heartbeat), the connection is preserved instead of dropped.
- **Crash Detection** — The plugin sends a heartbeat every 30 seconds to the instance registry. If Unity crashes and the heartbeat stops, the server detects the stale registry entry (>5 minutes old) and clears it, allowing proper re-discovery.
- **Port Affinity** — The plugin remembers its last-used port via EditorPrefs and reclaims it on restart, minimizing port swaps across editor restarts.

## Quick Start

### 1. Install the Unity Plugin

In Unity: **Window > Package Manager > + > Add package from git URL:**
```
https://github.com/AnkleBreaker-Studio/unity-mcp-plugin.git
```

### 2. Install this MCP Server

```bash
git clone https://github.com/AnkleBreaker-Studio/unity-mcp-server.git
cd unity-mcp-server
npm install
```

### 3. Add to Claude Desktop

Open Claude Desktop > Settings > Developer > Edit Config, and add:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "unity": {
      "command": "node",
      "args": ["C:/path/to/unity-mcp-server/src/index.js"],
      "env": {
        "UNITY_HUB_PATH": "C:\\Program Files\\Unity Hub\\Unity Hub.exe",
        "UNITY_BRIDGE_PORT": "7890"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Restart Claude Desktop. Done!

### 4. Try It

- *"List my installed Unity editors"*
- *"Show me the scene hierarchy"*
- *"Create a red cube at position (0, 2, 0) and add a Rigidbody"*
- *"Profile my scene and show the top memory consumers"*
- *"List all Shader Graphs in my project"*
- *"Build my project for Windows"*
- *"List and start my MPPM multiplayer scenarios"*
- *"Capture a screenshot of my scene view"*
- *"Show me the active agent sessions"*

## Configuration

| Environment Variable | Default | Description |
|---------------------|---------|-------------|
| `UNITY_HUB_PATH` | `C:\Program Files\Unity Hub\Unity Hub.exe` | Unity Hub executable path |
| `UNITY_BRIDGE_HOST` | `127.0.0.1` | Editor bridge host |
| `UNITY_BRIDGE_PORT` | `7890` | Editor bridge port (auto-discovered when using multi-instance) |
| `UNITY_BRIDGE_TIMEOUT` | `60000` | Request timeout in ms |
| `UNITY_PORT_RANGE_START` | `7890` | Start of port scan range for multi-instance discovery |
| `UNITY_PORT_RANGE_END` | `7899` | End of port scan range |
| `UNITY_REGISTRY_STALENESS_TIMEOUT` | `300000` | Registry entry staleness timeout in ms (crash detection) |
| `UNITY_RESPONSE_SOFT_LIMIT` | `2097152` | Response size soft limit in bytes (warning) |
| `UNITY_RESPONSE_HARD_LIMIT` | `4194304` | Response size hard limit in bytes (truncation) |
| `UNITY_MCP_DEBUG` | unset | Set to `1` to append diagnostics to `UnityMCP/mcp-debug.log` (5MB rotation) |
| `UNITY_MCP_PRETTY_JSON` | unset | Set to `1` to pretty-print tool responses (default is compact JSON — 20-50% fewer tokens) |
| `UNITY_MCP_COMPACT_TOOLS` | unset | Set to `1` for a minimal tools/list (~21KB vs ~43KB): keeps all 79 tools and strict schema structure, drops per-parameter prose. For clients with registry size limits (e.g. Codex Desktop on Windows) |

The Unity plugin also has its own settings accessible via the Dashboard (`Window > MCP Dashboard`) for port, auto-start, and per-category feature toggles.

## Optional Package Support

Some tools activate automatically when their packages are detected in the Unity project:

| Package / Asset | Features Unlocked |
|----------------|-------------------|
| `com.unity.memoryprofiler` | Memory snapshot capture via MemoryProfiler API |
| `com.unity.shadergraph` | Shader Graph creation, inspection, opening |
| `com.unity.visualeffectgraph` | VFX Graph listing and opening |
| `com.unity.inputsystem` | Input Action map and binding inspection |
| `com.unity.multiplayer.playmode` | MPPM scenario listing, activation, start/stop, player info |
| Amplify Shader Editor (Asset Store) | Amplify shader listing, inspection, opening |
| UMA 2 (Asset Store) | UMA SlotDataAsset/OverlayDataAsset creation, WardrobeRecipe pipeline, Global Library management, DCA wardrobe equip/unequip |

Features for uninstalled packages return helpful messages explaining what to install.

## Requirements

- Node.js 18+
- Unity Hub (for Hub tools)
- Unity Editor with [unity-mcp-plugin](https://github.com/AnkleBreaker-Studio/unity-mcp-plugin) installed (for Editor tools)

## Troubleshooting

**"Connection failed" errors** — Make sure Unity Editor is open and the plugin is installed. Check the Unity Console for `[MCP Bridge] Server started on port 7890`.

**"Unity Hub not found"** — Update `UNITY_HUB_PATH` in your config to match your installation.

**"Category disabled" errors** — A feature category may be toggled off. Open `Window > MCP Dashboard` in Unity to check category settings.

**Port conflicts** — Change `UNITY_BRIDGE_PORT` in your Claude config and update the port in Unity's MCP Dashboard settings.

## Why AnkleBreaker Unity MCP?

AnkleBreaker Unity MCP is the most comprehensive MCP integration for Unity, purpose-built to leverage the full power of **Claude Cowork** and other AI assistants. Here's how it compares to alternatives:

### Cost Comparison

> **AnkleBreaker Unity MCP is completely free and open source.** The prices below reflect only the cost of the AI assistant (Claude) itself — the MCP plugin and server are $0.

| Solution | Monthly Cost | What You Get |
|----------|:----------:|--------------| 
| **AnkleBreaker MCP (free) + Claude Pro** | **$20/mo** | 330+ tools, full Unity control, open source — MCP is free, price is Claude only |
| **AnkleBreaker MCP (free) + Claude Max 5x** | **$100/mo** | Same + 5x usage for heavy workflows — MCP is free, price is Claude only |
| **AnkleBreaker MCP (free) + Claude Max 20x** | **$200/mo** | Same + 20x usage for teams/studios — MCP is free, price is Claude only |
| **Bezi Pro** | $20/mo | ~30 tools, 800 credits/mo, freezes Unity |
| **Bezi Advanced** | $60/mo | ~30 tools, 2400 credits/mo, freezes Unity |
| **Bezi Team** | $200/mo | 3 seats, 8000 credits, still freezes Unity |
| **Unity AI** | Included with Unity Pro/Enterprise | Limited AI tools, Unity Points system, no MCP |
| **Coplay MCP** | Free (beta) | 34 tools, basic categories |

### Key Advantages

**vs. Bezi:**
Bezi runs as a proprietary Unity plugin with its own credit-based billing — $20–$200/mo on top of your AI subscription. It has historically suffered from freezing the Unity Editor during AI tasks, blocking your workflow. AnkleBreaker MCP is completely free and open source, runs entirely in the background with zero editor impact, and offers 8x more tools — the only cost is your existing Claude subscription.

**vs. Coplay MCP:**
Coplay MCP provides 34 tools across ~5 categories. AnkleBreaker MCP delivers 330+ tools across 30+ categories including advanced features like physics raycasts, terrain editing, shader graph management, profiling, NavMesh, particle systems, and MPPM multiplayer — none of which exist in Coplay. Our two-tier lazy loading system is specifically optimized for Claude Cowork's tool limits.

**vs. Unity AI:**
Unity AI (successor to Muse) is built into Unity 6.2+ but limited to Unity's own AI models and a credit-based "Unity Points" system. It cannot be used with Claude or any external AI assistant, has no MCP support, and offers a fraction of the automation capabilities. AnkleBreaker MCP works with any MCP-compatible AI while giving you full control over which AI models you use.

## What's New in v2.31.0 → v2.35.2

- **ProBuilder tool suite (14 tools)** — parametric shapes (11 types), face extrude/bevel/subdivide/delete/translate, per-face materials, boolean CSG with automatic source cleanup, combine, probuilderize, pivot centering, mesh export. Advanced tier, `probuilder` category. Companion to `unity-mcp-plugin` v2.35.0+.
- **Per-action undo (`unity_undo_last`)** — revert the most recent undoable MCP action as a whole; `agentId` targets a specific agent's last action; honest about Unity's linear undo (lists collateral, requires `force:true` to cascade). `unity_undo_history` is now a per-agent action log.
- **Three-level lazy discovery** — `unity_list_advanced_tools` `search=` / `category=` / `tool=`: finding one tool costs ~1KB of context instead of a 10–22KB dump; `includeSchemas:true` restores the one-round-trip echo. Plugin lazy-loaded routes appear in every view.
- **Reliability** — play-mode ticket-loss recovery (verifies editor state instead of a false 404), queue-poll transient-error hardening (no duplicate execution of non-idempotent ops), plugin-side `TimedOut` surfaced immediately, batch-wire degrade reports real failures, `overwrite:true` opt-in on all asset-creator tools (data-safety companion).
- **Token diet** — compact JSON responses by default, console stack-trace shaping (`includeStackTrace`), dense scene hierarchy (absent field = default value; `verbose:true` restores), tools/list ~45KB rich / ~23KB compact — all CI-budget-gated.
- **Test harness** — protocol suite over a mock bridge + MCP stdio client (57 tests, CI on Windows + Ubuntu), live suites against a real editor (`UNITY_MCP_LIVE=1 npm run test:live`, 15 tests incl. a full ProBuilder level build), capabilities handshake for version-skew (old plugin × new server and vice versa).

## What's New in v2.30.0

- **`unity_screenshot_editor_window` tool** — capture any Editor window (Inspector, Project, Console, custom editor windows) to a PNG. Unlike the game/scene capture tools (which render a camera), it grabs the real editor UI via the Win32 `PrintWindow` API, so it works even when the window is hidden behind other windows — no raising or focus-stealing. **Windows editor only**: on macOS/Linux it returns a clear "unsupported platform" message instead of capturing, and the assistant will tell you the feature isn't available on your OS. Defaults to `Assets/Screenshots/`, accepts any user-chosen `.png` path. The assistant only invokes it when you explicitly ask for an editor-window screenshot. Companion to `unity-mcp-plugin` v2.32.0.

## What's New in v2.28.2

- **Codex CLI compatibility** — Two diagnostic `console.debug(...)` calls in the bridge were writing to stdout, corrupting the MCP JSON-RPC framing. Strict clients like Codex CLI closed the transport as soon as they hit the non-JSON line; the bug was invisible on Claude Desktop / Claude Code which tolerate the framing violation. Both call sites now log to stderr.

## What's New in v2.28.0

- **npm auto-publish** — A GitHub Action now automatically publishes to npm whenever a new GitHub release is created. Contributed by [@vatanaksoytezer](https://github.com/vatanaksoytezer) in [#8](https://github.com/AnkleBreaker-Studio/unity-mcp-server/pull/8).
- **npm package renamed** — Package renamed from `unity-mcp-server` to `anklebreaker-unity-mcp` to avoid name conflict on npm. Install via `npx anklebreaker-unity-mcp@latest`.
- **SpriteAtlas tools** — 7 new tools for Unity SpriteAtlas management: create, inspect, add/remove sprites, configure packing & texture settings, delete, and list SpriteAtlases. Contributed by [@zaferdace](https://github.com/zaferdace). Registered as advanced tools accessible via `unity_advanced_tool`.
- **UTF-8 encoding fix** — Fixed corrupted characters in `unity-editor-bridge.js` comments and section headers.

## What's New in v2.27.0

- **UMA (Unity Multipurpose Avatar) integration** — 13 new tools for the complete UMA asset pipeline. Create SlotDataAssets, OverlayDataAssets, and WardrobeRecipes directly from FBX files, equip/unequip wardrobe items on DynamicCharacterAvatar, browse and manage the UMA Global Library, verify recipes for missing references, and more. Requires UMA 2 (available on the Asset Store). Registered as advanced tools accessible via `unity_advanced_tool`.

## What's New in v2.26.0

- **Compilation error detection** — New `unity_get_compilation_errors` tool retrieves C# compilation errors and warnings directly from Unity's `CompilationPipeline` API. Unlike `unity_console_log`, this is independent of the console log buffer — not affected by console clear, Play Mode log flooding, or buffer overflow. Supports filtering by severity (`error`, `warning`, `all`) and count limit. Registered as a core tool (always directly accessible, not behind `unity_advanced_tool`).

## What's New in v2.25.0

- **Parallel-safe instance routing** — When multiple AI agents (e.g. Claude Cowork tasks) share the same MCP process, each agent can now include a `port` parameter in every `unity_*` tool call to guarantee routing to the correct Unity Editor instance. This prevents cross-agent contamination where one task's `unity_select_instance` could redirect another task's commands to the wrong project.
- **Per-request port override** — A new stateless routing mechanism bypasses the shared per-agent state entirely. The `port` parameter is extracted by middleware before the tool handler runs, used for routing, then stripped from the args. This is safe because MCP stdio transport processes requests sequentially.
- **Schema injection** — The optional `port` parameter is automatically injected into every `unity_*` tool schema (except `unity_list_instances`, `unity_select_instance`, and `unity_hub_*`), so AI assistants see it as a legitimate parameter and pass it consistently.
- **Enhanced select_instance response** — `unity_select_instance` now returns explicit routing instructions telling the AI to include `port` in all subsequent calls.

## Frequently Asked Questions

**What is Unity MCP?**
Unity MCP (Model Context Protocol) is an open-source integration that connects AI assistants like Claude, Cursor, and Windsurf to the Unity Editor and Unity Hub. It allows AI to directly control Unity — creating scenes, placing objects, writing scripts, running builds, profiling, and more — through a standardized protocol.

**How does AnkleBreaker Unity MCP compare to other Unity AI tools?**
AnkleBreaker Unity MCP offers 330+ tools across 30+ categories, making it the most comprehensive Unity MCP integration available. Competitors like Bezi (~30 tools) and Coplay MCP (34 tools) cover a fraction of Unity's features. Unlike Bezi, AnkleBreaker MCP is free, open source, and doesn't freeze the Unity Editor during AI operations.

**Does it work with Claude Desktop / Claude Cowork?**
Yes. AnkleBreaker Unity MCP is purpose-built for Claude Desktop and Claude Cowork. It uses a two-tier lazy loading system to stay within MCP client tool limits while exposing all 330+ tools on demand.

**Does it work with Cursor, Windsurf, or other MCP clients?**
Yes. Any AI tool that supports the Model Context Protocol can connect to this server. This includes Cursor, Windsurf, Claude Desktop, Claude Cowork, and any other MCP-compatible client.

**What Unity versions are supported?**
Unity 2021.3 LTS and newer, including Unity 2022.3 LTS and Unity 6. The plugin is installed via Unity Package Manager (UPM).

**Is it free?**
Yes. Both the MCP server and the Unity plugin are completely free and open source under the AnkleBreaker Open License. The only cost is your AI assistant subscription (e.g., Claude Pro at $20/month).

**Can multiple AI agents use it simultaneously?**
Yes. The server supports multi-agent operation with session tracking, action logging, and queued execution to prevent conflicts. It also supports multiple Unity Editor instances running side-by-side.

**Does it support Amplify Shader Editor?**
Yes. If Amplify Shader Editor is installed in your project, 23 additional tools are unlocked for full shader graph manipulation — creating nodes, connecting them, setting properties, using templates, and more. Projects without Amplify work perfectly; the tools gracefully report that ASE is not installed.
